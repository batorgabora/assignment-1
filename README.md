These are some of the C# projects I worked on throughout last year while preparing for my matura exams. <br>
                    They started out as programming exercises meant to strengthen my understanding of C# syntax and basic algorithms, 
                    but gradually became small explorations of logic, recursion, and mathematical thinking. <br><br>
                    I used these projects to experiment with console input/output, loops, functions, and different ways of approaching the same problem — 
                    from simple number operations to recursive algorithms and convergence tests. <br><br>
                    Running these projects on macOS was a bit trickier — Visual Studio for Mac doesn’t handle console apps directly, 
                    so I learned to use Bash and the .NET CLI to build and execute them in the terminal.
                    This gave me hands-on experience with environment setup and command-line workflows on macOS as well.
