    <h1>about me</h1>

    <p> hey, I’m Bátor, an 18-year-old student from Debrecen, Hungary, currently studying Software and Technology
        Engineering at VIA in Horsens, Denmark. <br><br>
        in my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, watching films, and reading philosophy and literature. <br><br>
        and when possible I try travel, hike and make the most out of the world around me<br><br>
        I'm curious and detail-oriented, I enjoy tackling challenges, learning new skills, and collaborating with others
        to bring ideas to life. <br><br>
        my goal is to work on projects that combine innovation with meaningful impact and also have a sense of
        originality, while
        continuing to explore the world and gain new perspectives.
    </p>
