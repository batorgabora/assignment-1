                <p>
                    this is a js and html project, originally following <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY&si=HxeXSpk8B4t9GKn_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a>, 
                    and later expanded through trial, error, and research. <br>
                    you can save or delete the best-performing car and let mutations improve (or worsen) it — the mutation rate can be adjusted. <br>
                    you can also change the number of input neurons and hidden-layer neurons, which resets the saved best car. <br>
                    the number of lanes and traffic can be adjusted, as well as the number of self-driving cars. <br><br>
                    after any change, simply refresh the page to start again. <br><br>
                    and the fun part: using wasd keyboard inputs, you can race the best car yourself.

                <h3>weather project</h3>

                <p>
                    I made this project about a year ago while still in high school — it was mostly to get familiar with Swift and working with APIs, but it turned out quite well. <br>
                    I built it using Xcode and the OpenWeather API, adding extra features like searching for cities and detecting the user’s location (if agreed). <br><br>

                    //functionality: <br>
                    earth globe icon: random weather of 20 cities around the world <br>
                    city icon: weather in Debrecen <br>
                    location icon: weather in user’s current location <br>
                    magnifying glass icon: weather of searched city <br>
                    + includes forecasts as well <br><br>

                    //extra info: <br>
                    the scripts can be found in the weather directory, organized into separate subfolders. <br>
                    to make it work, add a <code>Secrets.plist</code> file to the resources directory based on the provided <code>Secrets-template.plist</code>, and include your own API key from OpenWeather.
